# Countless Google Searches, Open Tab Back-and-Forth, & History Scrolling

More and more developer resources live online nowadays - tutorial sites, Stack Overflow posts, documentation & open source packages, wikis & blog posts - the list goes on and on.

This, combined with the constant switching back to the IDE and other tools, often causes developers to lose track of where they were and start over again at the search bar.

The <a target="_blank" href={pieces_app.links.website.pfd_desktop_install}>Pieces for Developers | Desktop App</a> ships with a first-in-kind <a target="_blank" href={pieces_app.links.internal.global_search_suggestion_reuse.workflow_activity_stream}>Workflow Activity Stream</a> that lets you pick up where you left off faster than ever.
