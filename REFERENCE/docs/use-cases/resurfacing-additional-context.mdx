# Resurfacing Additional Context in Collaborative Environments

Task and project context regarding the who, what, where, and why is often discussed over a variety of channels such as Email, Slack, Teams, Discord, Community Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and more.

Keeping track of this critical context - decision outcomes, architectures, implementation solutions, best practices, power tips, configs - is becoming harder than ever.
