# Workflow Activity Stream

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/WORKFLOW_ACTIVITY.gif)

Picking up where you left off and getting back into flow is one of the largest productivity bottlenecks in a developer's workflow. So, our team has been hard at work making it easier than ever to backtrack through your work-in-progress journey.

Our **Workflow Activity Stream and Process Backtracking** enables you to quickly find and access useful context metadata that's been associated with your saved materials.

## Workflow Details
Workflow details and points of reference such as <a target="_blank" href="/features/auto-enrichment">related links</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/features/one-click-snippet-sharing">shared snippets</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/features/auto-enrichment#tags">relevant tags</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/features/auto-enrichment#related-people">collaborators</a>, and more are all available as a scrollable timeline in our Desktop Application.

## Workflow Activity Search & Filters
In the Workflow Activity view, you can search to quickly find a specific event in your workflow even more quickly. You can search for events related to creation, references, and more by tying in <a target="_blank" href={pieces_app.links.internal.context_awareness_engine.origin_details}>context details</a> to narrow down the search.

When navigating and utilizing powerful snippets, Workflow Activity can get filled up fast! Use **Search Filters** to narrow down your search to a specific type.

### Created:
View only creation events. These events are oriented around creating a snippet from any product in the Pieces Suite, such as saving a snippet from the <a target="_blank" href={pieces_app.links.extensions.chrome}>Pieces Chrome Extension</a>, or saving from one of your favorite IDE, like <a target="_blank" href={pieces_app.links.extensions.jetbrains}>JetBrains</a> or <a target="_blank" href={pieces_app.links.extensions.vscode}>VS Code</a>.

### Updated:
View only snippet update events. Each updated event comes from adding to or removing content in the snippet itself or from any changes to the metadata in the Information View.

### Deleted:
Deleted events pertain to removing an entire snippet/asset from Pieces for Developers - from any product in the Pieces Suite.

### Referenced:
Reference events take place in the background and are attributed to a snippet when you view it for some time.

As you use Pieces, the algorithm will balance itself out to lower unwanted or unnecessary events.
