# Code Completion

Our intelligent Code Completion feature is designed to provide an efficient and seamless coding experience by auto-completing code snippets from saved materials in your personal Pieces micro-repository.

This feature is particularly useful when writing previously saved boilerplate code, unit tests, or marketing scripts such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel Tags in your IDE with our [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode) and [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets) plugins. By leveraging our on-device Pattern Engine, the Code Completion feature offers a complementary approach to existing Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementations and LLM offerings, such as [GitHub Co-Pilot and Tabnine](https://code.pieces.app/blog/github-copilot-vs-chatgpt-vs-tabnine-feature-comparison).

## Key Features

### Integration with saved code snippets

Our Code Completion feature is specifically designed to auto-complete from your saved code snippets. This allows for a more personalized and context-aware auto-completion experience, as it suggests code that you've previously saved and used in similar scenarios.

### Complementary approach

Code Completion is designed to work alongside existing LSP implementations and LLM offerings, providing a focused and complementary auto-completion experience. This ensures that you receive relevant suggestions from your saved code snippets when it makes the most sense.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Code Completion feature, follow these simple steps:

1. **Save your code snippets**: Add your frequently used code snippets, boilerplates, and marketing scripts to your personal collection on the [Pieces for Developers Desktop App](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing).
2. **Download the IDE plugin**: Download our [JetBrains IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets) or [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode) to leverage the power of Pieces in your IDE.
3. **Use the feature**: Start typing in your preferred code editor, and the Code Completion feature will automatically suggest relevant saved code snippets as you type.
