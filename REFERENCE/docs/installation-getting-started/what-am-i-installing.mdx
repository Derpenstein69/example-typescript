## What is Pieces OS?

[Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/pieces-os) operates as a background service that functions both offline and on-device to facilitate communication among individual products within the Pieces for Developers Suite. Its core functions include the management of local, private, and secure machine learning models used for the [Pieces Copilot](/features/pieces-copilot), as well as [real-time search](/features/search-modes) and suggestions.

Pieces OS enables Pieces products and local LLMs to operate 100% locally on your machine, with an option to connect to the cloud for [backup](/features/back-up-and-restore), [sharing](/features/one-click-snippet-sharing), and cloud-based LLMs for code generation.
