title: Privacy, Security & Your Data
description:  Let's jump in and touch on privacy, data, cloud-based features, and our ML models.
---

From day 1 of building Pieces for Developers, we've had a first principle that everything is local first and built with speed, privacy, security, and offline-productivity in mind.

We also know that our partners **operate in highly secure and sensitive environments**, and we want to be prepared to operate in such environments (HIPAA, SOC 2, FERPA/COPPA, etc.). That being said - we can't tell you how happy we are that we have stayed true to this philosophy for cases just like yours!

## We are SOC 2 Compliant üîí {#we-are-soc-2-compliant}

SOC 2 is a prestigious benchmark in the tech industry, especially important for companies like ours. It verifies that we meet strict organizational controls and practices, enhancing our credibility and trustworthiness in the market.

This achievement is a collective triumph for our team, reflecting our dedication to maintaining a secure and reliable service. It's an essential step forward in our mission to provide word class developer tools.

## Our Machine Learning Models
Pieces has our own internal ML models that we use to power some of our features. We have a few different models, and they are all built with privacy and security in mind.

:::info Local Processing

Our ML models are designed to function entirely offline and on-device, eliminating the need for internet connectivity. This is possible by opting out of blended processing, as the models are integrated within the application's binary, ensuring seamless operation without requiring an internet connection.

:::

If you have **not opted out of blended processing,** then some of the models will offload computation to the cloud. A few of our models are **only** available in the cloud, but we are working on making them local.

This table shows which models are available locally and which will use cloud compute unless processing is set to local.
| **Model**                      	| **Local** 	| **Blended** 	|

| Title Generation               	|      ‚úÖ     	|       ‚úÖ      |

Our ML models are not trained continuously. **They do not train on your data** as you use the product.

## Saving Code Snippets in the Cloud
The Pieces cloud is entirely opt-in. Authentication is managed by our enterprise-ready authentication partners at Auth0 (now owned by Okta).

Even when a user signs in, they do not have a cloud until they specifically connect it in their [settings](/features/user-settings#private-cloud-beta).

If a user opts into the cloud, the data is only uploaded when something is shared.

When you click the "Share" icon and create a shareable link, only then is the snippet uploaded and accessible via the cloud.

Finally, a note on cloud architecture for the things that are backed up:
- There is no centralized database; each user has their own micro-database
- There are no centralized or shared servers
- Each user has their own Cloud Run instance, with their own unique subdomain and their own micro load balancer

Every user's cloud scales up and down completely independent of other users. The cloud is only running when a shared snippet is being accessed, backed up, or updated, and we can easily port our docker images over to an existing "Panasonic Cloud" if needed.

## Telemetry & Crash Data
Most importantly, all data collection is opt-out, and we give all the control to our users.

The data that we do collect is completely anonymous and highly secure (we take data very seriously).

### Why do we collect data?
Long story short, we're an early-stage startup and the data helps us to report on overall growth and hopefully earn more funding to continue building amazing products for our users.

Here are some screenshots of Telemetry opt-outs from the Pieces products:
